## Introduction

This project implements a GAN that generates images of different shapes and colors based on text embeddings. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator that are trained together to improve the quality of generated images.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
